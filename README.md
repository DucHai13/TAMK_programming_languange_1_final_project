# TAMK_programming_languange_1_final_project
Author: Hai Chu
Date of create: 





This is my final assignment for my programming language 1 course at TAMK. 
The assignment is to create a simple booking program with some features.
This project is created and modified on visual studio community 2022, so if there is any problem executing the project, it is best to first consider updating your compiler/IDE to the latest version.
