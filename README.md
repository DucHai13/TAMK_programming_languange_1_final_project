# # Preface
This is my final assignment for my programming language 1 course at TAMK. 
The assignment is to create a simple booking program with some features.
This project is created and modified on visual studio community 2022, so if there is any problem executing the project, it is best to first consider updating your compiler/IDE to the latest version.


# # Instruction
The booking program consist of:
  1. Add a new customer
  2. Add rooms to this customer
  3. Move on to another customer/ Open the menu
  4. In the menu, choose one of the following:
    a. Print all the customer to the screen.
    b. Search for a customer
    c. Add more customer.
    d. Change information of a customer.
    e. Close the menu.
  5. After you have chosen 1 of the 4 function above, continue following the instruction on the screen.


# # Update
There is currently no update yet. I am researching on how to do Window form so the project looks like an application.
